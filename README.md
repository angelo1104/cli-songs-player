# cli-songs-player

We all have been in a situation where we want to play through a bunch of downloaded songs but are too lazy to constantly close your previous song and play another.
This node js app will just do that.

## Just clone the repo and run npm install

Add your favorite songs to the folder where you cloned the repo in the root directory of the repo and enjoy node app.js
